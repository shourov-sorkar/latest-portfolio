              I'm deeply enthusiastic about building things that matter. Creating scalable, user-focused web and mobile applications isn't just my jobâ€”it's something I genuinely enjoy. With a solid background in JavaScript and TypeScript, I work across the stack using technologies like React.js, NEXT.js, Angular, Node.js, Express.js, and ASP.NET. I take pride in crafting clean, maintainable code that powers real-world products.

            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              For mobile development, I turn to React Native to build high-quality, cross-platform applications that feel native and perform smoothly.
            </p>
            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              From integrating REST APIs and WebSockets to managing data with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL, I focus on performance and reliability. I'm also experienced in deploying secure, cloud-native solutions on AWS and Azure App Service.
            </p>
            <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
              I care deeply about good architecture, developer experience, and delivering features that truly make an impact. Whether it's building from scratch or scaling existing systems, I aim to create solutions that are both efficient and elegant.
